        <div class="text_eight">
            <div class="text_eight_one">trust as a virtue has consistently played an essential role in every 
                great human achievement. and consistently, its importance has 
                been overlooked. not just by individuals, but by entire societies. 
                we felt it was time someone gave it the spotlight it deserves. 
                especially for the ones who live by this virtue: the trustworthy.
            </div>
            <div class="text_eight_two">
                so we thought of creating a system that rewards its members for 
                doing good and being trustworthy. this way, trust as a virtue 
                becomes something to aspire to, just the way it should be. then we 
                went one step ahead: we built it. we know we are on the right 
                track because here you are.
            </div>
            <div class="text_eight_three">
                if you make it to CRED, congratulations and welcome. we have a 
                lot of things planned for you.
